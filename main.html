      <h3>Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great salmon cookies with our friends and help make the world a little better.</h3>
      <section id="mission">
        <p>We love our hometown. We love everything that makes Seattle such a dynamic hub to live, work and play. We love sipping a cup with our friends and neighbors, taking in top-notch arts and entertainment, enjoying the fresh air, green spaces, the strong sense of community and, yes, even the rain.</p>
        <p>From our first store in Pike Place, to our customers that live here, we’re proud of our coffee-fueled homegrown roots. Our dedication to thriving neighborhoods, community service, local arts and environmental stewardship is all part of the vested interest and commitment to the place we call home.</p>
        <p>Since our first batch of salmon cookies, we’ve been committed to supporting the local community through partnerships with like-minded organizations about town, from our commitment to the highest quality salmon cookies in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.</p>
